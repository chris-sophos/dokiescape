<details>
  <summary>Stuck?</summary>
  A green highlight means the tile is interactable. (click to interact)

  A black highlight means the tile is out of range or is cannot be interacted (chests that have already been opened, D.A.D. before clearing tracks, trapdoor before sending D.A.D. through)

  You have you send D.A.D. through the trapdoor before you can go.

  Press R to restart the current level.

  Only small bombs can be detonated manually, medium and large bombs have to be triggered by other explosions.

## About

2D top-down puzzle game, made in ~5 days for [Doki Jam!](https://itch.io/jam/doki-jam)

Solo dev moment

I'm mostly a dev, so my own graphics are pretty bad and level design/mechanics are kind obtuse...

See the "**Stuck?**" section above if you can't figure something out!

## Controls
- WASD to move.
- R to restart level.
- Left click to interact, select items, and use items.
- Right click to pick up bombs.
- NumRow 1-4 to select inventory items.
- (Debug) `[`/`]` to load previous/next level.
